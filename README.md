This localguide app allows people to make a travel todo + post blogs or trip information for other users to exploit. 

For now we only have one user and there is no authentication required. But, in the future we will have more users and authentication is a must! 

Problems:
1) For some reason Provider is not working
2) Even though firebase is downloaded, but it still says is not a function (it was working before tho)


Future plans:
1) Create User Database with pics and videos about the trips
2) Create User Profile page with capability of CRUD of the trips + reminders with alarm
3) Sell+Buy options

```
	> npm install
	> npm start
```
